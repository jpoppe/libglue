# libGlue

## :warning: DISCLAIMER

**TLDR**

:dragon: :dragon: :dragon: :dragon:

**libGlue is a WIP with some scary code I took *blind* from my projects from the last 10 years
and is not ready public usage!**

:dragon: :dragon: :dragon: :dragon:

Code needs to get refactored, etc.

But since releasing is not easy and I have been sitting on quite some personal :snake: projects for many
:full_moon: == many lines of code.

Also my :heart: for Python :snake: came somehow back (and now we have types :thinking: :smile:).

Let's see where this will go. :rocket:

Grtz,

Poppe :kiss:
